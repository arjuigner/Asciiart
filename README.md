# Asciiart

Asciiart is a small project I did to learn about the streamlit python library.
It allows you to turn any image (for now only png is supported) into ascii art.

### Usage

Make sure you have `streamlit` installed, and use the command `streamlit run asciiart.py`.
This should open a tab in your browser, with a button to upload a picture and a few options.
